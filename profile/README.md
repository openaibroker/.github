## Who is it for?

### AI platforms - implementing the API

If you offer the ability to discover and use AI models (e.g. serverless GPU provider for inference) or AI Agents (e.g. an agent marketplace), we recommend you consider implementing the Open AI Broker API. This will help consumers of your platform integrate to your API and easily explore the catalog of services you have to offer.

### Software developers

If you are a software developer who wants to consume AI models or AI Agents from one-or-more providers, check to see if they if they provide Open AI Broker API endpoints. If they do, you can quickly add their complete catalog to your application cutting down on your development time (no need to manually add and maintain APIs/SDKs for every provider) and giving your users options to choose from.
